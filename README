RED INVADERS
A simple Space Invaders reprise, done in Unity3D and C#

It just started as a simple test to get a job, but sprung some interest in completing and upgrading it.

As of now, the code is quite messy (the EnemyManager is hideous) and leaves a whole lot of room for improvement. Still, this was designed and coded in 4 days. A whole new record for me.

When this Windows standalone version is done, I intend to port it to Android devices.
